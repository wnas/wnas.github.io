I took some stuff written by better javascripters than me (<a title="martin's page" href="http://www.windgazer.nl">Martin</a>,  <a title="domscripting" href="http://www.domscripting.com/book/sample/">Jeremy Keith</a> and <a title="ppk, whose book I am reading now." href="http://www.quirksmode.org">Peter-Paul Koch</a> among others) and together with a co-worker, Tino Loos, decided to add some things.But first of, let me say, this is not a post about wether you <strong>should</strong> use popup&#39;s.
