It focuses more on C and cocoa apps, but I think that these tips will work for javascript and css just as well. Here is one:<a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2007/05/uncle-jenss-coding-tips/" title="uncle-jenss-coding-tips" rel="external"><blockquote>â€œthe main person youâ€™re writing comments for is yourself, six months in the future.â€?</blockquote></a>Maybe it is time that we  front-end people realised that we are not so different and that we need to grow up. (saying that in a &#39; do as I say, not as I do&#39; kinda way.) I mean, for the most part the front end code that I see and , to be perfectly honest, some that I deliver is not very wel crafted. I mean, take a look at some of the code that I am working with right now:<code>#k-192-560-1 {  width: 195;  margin: 0px;}</code>The basic idea was very simple, I see that (as you can). The developer started from a graphic design of some sort and thought: &#39; this part is divided into two column&#39;s of 192 and 560 pixels wide&#39;. And on they went, naming some vital part of the code completly wrong. Omitting values and inserting them in places where they aren&#39;t needed.The fun thing is that people don&#39;t do these things to bug you, but still. The naming is far from semanticly correct and now is second on my list. The problem which these people hadn&#39;t considered was that different browsers show things differently.A utterly new concepts I found out some 10+ years  ago...And after you go through a couple of box models, the naming doesn&#39;t quite makes sense anymore. And don&#39;t even start about a different graphic design in a few years or months...The first place on my list is (still going strong) <strong><code>.alignRight {text-align: left;}</code></strong>Do any of you have simular examples, to share, please do. Or do you wish to tell me about any of the mistakes you made in the past...</article></body></html>
