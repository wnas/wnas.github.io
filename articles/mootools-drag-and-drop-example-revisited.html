And instead of bitching about is, I decided to  try and change it myself.  Snook made sure that the draggable thingy was transparent, by setting its opacity in the javascript code like thisAs I said before, I like to keep my presentation seperate from my behaviour (and structure ofcourse). So I decided to change that to:<pre>//this.el.setOpacity(.5); // snookthis.el.addClassName(&#39;dragged&#39;); // wnas added</pre>And to remove the className I changed<pre>//this.el.setOpacity(1); // snookthis.el.removeClassName(&#39;dragged&#39;); // wnas added</pre>Ofcourse I added something in the css to let it do something (please note id added in order for the style to take effect)<pre>#dragger.dragged {opacity: .5; /<em> firefox </em>/filter: alpha(opacity=50); /<em> ie </em>/}</pre>I hope that my two cents help anyone, to seperate behaviour, structure and presentation.Here are the files to let you test and improve it for your selfs... <a onmousedown="selectLink(181)" id="p181" href="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/mootoolsdragdrop.htm"><a onmousedown="selectLink(181)" id="p181" href="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/mootoolsdragdrop.htm">the html page</a><a onmousedown="selectLink(180)" id="p180" href="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/mootools.release.51.js"><a onmousedown="selectLink(180)" id="p180" href="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/mootools.release.51.js">mooTools</a></article></body></html>
