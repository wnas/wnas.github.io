But his lecture gave me inspiration to give you a series of small tricks on how to use &#39;advanced&#39; css selectors together with javascript snippets on how to make it work in IE..First of, <strong>last child selectors</strong>.Sometimes you have to put a special emphasis on something like say a last list item. With good css you would do something like this...<pre>#foo li:last-child {do: something;}</pre>but wait, I hear you say, IE doesn&#39;t support last-child, so I can&#39;t use it. No, but now javascript comes to the rescue!After hearing the great <a title="adactio" href="http://adactio.com/">jeremy keith</a> speak on javascript and how it is <a title="podcast" href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/blog/index.php/jeremy-keith-using-dom-scripting-to-plug-holes-in-css-podcast/">good for you</a>, I decided to take on the dom my self. After all, I have been frustrated by the lack of standards support in IE for a long time now. Time to strike back.so javascript to the rescue.<pre>function lastListItem () {var k = document.getElementById(&#39;foo&#39;);if (k) {var last = k.lastChild;last.className += &quot;InExLIlast&quot;;}}</pre>all we have to do now is extend our style sheet with the ie className, which we have given a prefix to distinguise it from the normal (read correct) css classes. So our css becomes:<pre>#foo li.InExLIlast,  #foo li:last-child {do: something;}</pre><strong>Update</strong>Kevin, in response to your question, the function is called in the following way.<pre>function include() {lastListItem()someOtherFunction()}window.attachEvent(&quot;onload&quot;, include);</pre>There you go, one more trick up your sleeve.If you have any comments, questions or something like that let me know.</article></body></html>
