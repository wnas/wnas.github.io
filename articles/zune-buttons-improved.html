The Zune and all over the web review are being written. Some not so nice and all, or allmost all of them, have one thing in common. The buttons are not marked and therefor confusing.I beg to differ, as I know that people get used to many microsoft quirks over years. So they will get used to these also. But what was bothering me, was that many people spelled out the mistakes, but not one did so with a suggestion for an improvement.So, that is what I will do. First let&#39;s take a look at the buttons of the Zune as they are now.<img width="89" height="96" alt="zune1.gif" id="image202" src="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/zune1.thumbnail.gif">As you can see, they are unmarked by any signs. The user is not being assisted in any way...In my line of field (user interface design) this is bad...But if you stay with me for a minute I will show you my solution. (knowing that there are  probaly much better ways to do this, but he...)<!--more-->The reason, I read, that there are no markings on the buttons is that the Zune can be used in two orientations. Standing up or laying down.What I thought, stops microsoft to put small lights beneath the surface of the buttons that shine through. The player must know in what mode it is being used, and should light the correct set to accomodate the situation...See for yourself what my idea is...standing up: <img width="89" height="96" alt="zune2.gif" id="image203" src="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/zune2.thumbnail.gif">laying down: <img width="128" height="78" alt="zune3.gif" id="image204" src="http://www.wnas.nl/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/zune3.thumbnail.gif">I believe that this is a viable solution, it gave me something to think about anyway, so...If you have any thoughts on the subject, please let me know...(and if you are bill gates and like to pay for it...)</article></body></html>
