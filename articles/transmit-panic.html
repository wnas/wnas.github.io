(mac users will know) I decided to try a new program, Transmit from panic. Yes, the same panic that brought us audion, the mp3 player we used before Itunes...It has some quirks in using, but my first impression is that it is beautifull, and that helps. I will keep you posted about my opinion of this program..</article></body></html>
