So I will be kinda incommunicado and not be returning email&#39;s any sooner than usual.</p><p>Please have some patience as I will be back to work on monday. If you are attending, please stop by and say hi. For updates I refer to my <a href="http://twitter.com/wnas">twitter</a> stream, instead of the (so 2008) live blogging I used to do in some cases.</p></article></body></html>
