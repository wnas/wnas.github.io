The necessary IE conditional comment aside, I tend to avoid them. But something a standardista must do what he has to do in order to make things work.To serve a style sheet to safari and opera only, I came across a simple hack. Instead of using<code>&#60;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&#62;</code>use this instead<code>&#60;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;foo/css&quot; href=&quot;safari.css&quot; /&#62;</code>This sets you up with a style sheet which is only read by safari and opera. As long as they don&#39;t fix it that is.As long as it works, and I can&#39;t stress this enough so I will say it again<strong>As long as it works</strong><p><em>Update, this doesn&#39;t work in safari 3.0 beta mac, in windows I haven&#39;t been able to test it, but I guess  that It won&#39;t work there either. Don&#39;t worry though, the hack was mostly usefull to overcome safari&#39;s inability to style input elements, something that safari 3.0 can.</em></p>It will give you a way to serve seperate stylesheets to just about any browser today. Use the <a title="safari hack" href="http://www.ibloomstudios.com/article1/">safari # hack</a> by adding a # after a semi colon, to exclude stuff for safari and therefor giving opera the styles it needs (to escape possible safari/opera problems). Use <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html" title="conditional comments">conditional comments</a> for IE&#39;s different versions and give firefox what it needs (that is valid css) and your in business.<em>I came across this hack when developing &#39;internet aangifte&#39; for the dutch police, as it needed to work in just about any browser available, which is a good thing. The only problem is that we haven&#39;t been able (yet) to fix apache struts invalid rendering of the hidden input tag. So the site is not valid xhtml, which is a pity...</em></article></body></html>
