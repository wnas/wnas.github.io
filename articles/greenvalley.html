This is the second of the three way shootout and I was curious as I didn&#39;t know anything about green valley. I heard a couple of things, to be honest no good things, but I tried to keep an open mind. After all, all of the three vendors deserve a honest chance, not that my opinion is that important. But after the preliminaries lets start with my impression of green valley.<!--more-->The first session started of not too great, they were late by half an hour. Than they experienced some technical difficulties, to put it mildly. They counted on a good internet connection with access to certain ports, which they did not had. This hindered the demo a great deal, as they did not had a working enviroment locally. To put it mildly, they were not able to walk through all of the scenarios that we wanted them to, thus hindering us in getting a good impression of the whole system.<em>So lesson learned today is: <strong>Come prepared</strong>. A while ago I had a presentation session on presentation by <a href="http://www.peterketel.nl/">Peter Ketel</a>, who strongly stated that you shouldn&#39;t depend on technology. He was right, put in this mix a presenter how couldn&#39;t stick with his own story and wandered all around it and you got yourself in quite a situation.</em>The content of the presentation self was quite good, they showed some good features, such as friendly url&#39;s. The overall impression of the editor site of the cms was not consistent, meta data is being added in a confusing and potentially dangerous way. Features look added without much thought about the total picture, but for the need to check all the questions in a standard RFP<em> (Request For Proposal)</em>. So they did not necessarily added to the usability of the product, better fewer but balanced features than more (Ipod anyone).The technical session went not much better, as they still were not able to overcome the limitations of the technique and had brought a slow laptop. This happened to hippo too, why is that, don&#39;t these people test their stuff and buy a faster laptop for stuff like this? The tech guy who they rushed in did his best but didn&#39;t know his audience so he wasted our time explaining what a tld was and such.Overall though this session went way better than the first one, they showed some interesting things. The way to produce templates was easy but, according to them I still needed a training to do it. To be honest something I took as a insult of my intelligence, as I have been doing this stuff for a while now. But as I said before, they didn&#39;t know their audience, so I  won&#39;t hold a grudge. Further more they showed that they used (valid?) xhtml, but served to a browser in such a way that Internet Explorer still renders it as tag soup. They had more of those slips, such as in response to my question they admitted that the heard of Yahoo!&#39;s research in front end load, but obviously hadn&#39;t looked past the title of Nate&#39;s presentation at @media.first Impression:<h5>Not good</h5></article></body></html>
