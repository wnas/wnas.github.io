CSS attribute selectors are fine, only no JavaScript detection.</p></blockquote><p>As it turns out, I was mistaken. It is quite possible to detect the type of the input elements, all it takes is the reading of the  type attribute, like this:</p><pre><code>$(&#39;input&#39;).each(function(){    var tt = this.getAttribute(&#39;type&#39;);    if(!tt)tt=&#39;text&#39;;    this.className +=&#39; input-&#39;+tt;});</code></pre><p>And voila, we have got a class on the element, with which we can style it or hook some javascript onto it...</p></article></body></html>
