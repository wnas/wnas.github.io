It will be very helpful when you don&#39;t have the freedom to fully control your HTML you are working with.</p><p>I mean we have next sibling, general sibling and direct child, why can&#39;t we have <em>previous</em> child or while we&#39;re at it, direct parent. So I want something to complement these…</p><pre><code>foo &gt; bar { }/<em> child combinators    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#child-combinators">spec</a></em>/foo ~ bar { }/<em> general sibling     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#general-sibling-combinators">specs</a></em>/foo + bar { }/<em> adjacent sibling selector     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#adjacent-sibling-combinators">specs</a></em>//<em> what I want is a previous selector, like this </em>/foo - bar { }/<em> and a parent selector… </em>/foo &#60; bar </code></pre><p>The problem is browsers now, I&#39;ve been told that it is really hard to implement. So while we are waiting on something that may never come, we might as well work on a <em>make shift</em> solution. I&#39;ve build on in javascript and put it on <a href="https://github.com/wnas/jquery-plugins/tree/master/previousSelector">Github</a>. It&#39;s pretty simple and I&#39;m sure that somebody can improve upon it.</p><h2>Update </h2><p>See this <a href="http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/">article</a> on extending jQuery&#39;s selector capabilities too. / thanks to <a href="twitter.com/eising">@eising</a>.</p></article></body></html>
