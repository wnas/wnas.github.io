Certainly not about the one for windows. I have it installed and all, yes it is buggy, yes it is unsafe. But as I saw two of my fellow Happy cloggers, already blog about it, so go see them.</p><p><a href="http://juice10.com/blog/articles/2007/06/12/safari-3-beta-launched-also-for-windows">Justin</a> and <a href="http://arjaneising.nl/browsers/safari-for-windows-or">Arjan</a>. Now that I think about <a href="http://www.happyclog.nl/">happy clog </a>again, beer anyone?</p><p>All fun aside, I think and hope that safari 3 will be used by many people. Not in the least by web developers running windows. They will get the chance to test stuff in safari, so all of your excuses are gone... Hopefully, we will see more websites and applications supporting safari. The most used excuse that I heard a lot, <em>We don&#39;t use apple so we can&#39;t test it, and nobody else is running it, look at our stats...</em>, is gone.</p></article></body></html>
