If somebody has an opinion about it, I would love to hear it.</p><p>I have been using the <strong>$</strong> suffix for variables that are really jQuery objects. But I keep coming across occurrences that need the real variable, aka not the jQuery one.</p><p>So what I tend to do now is something like:</p><pre><code>collection : {    $foo    : $(&#39;.bar&#39;),    foo        : &#39;.bar&#39;}</code></pre><p>In this way I can use both the jQuery object easily and the normal variable, like this:</p><pre><code>// use the jQuery objectcollection.$foo.<em>action()</em>// use the normal object$(&#39;body&#39;).find(collection.foo)</code></pre><p>What do you think, is this too much or do you use this too?</p><p><em>I am trying to get a better last example, &#39;cause this ain&#39;t all that clear I think...</em></p></article></body></html>
