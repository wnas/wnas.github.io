<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css"></head><body><nav><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/about">About</a></nav><article><h2>Datetime in habari</h2><p>Right now I am reading the most excellent <a href="http://introducinghtml5.com/">book</a> by the esteemed <a href="http://twitter.com/brucel" rel="met">Bruce Lawson</a> and his partner in crime <a href="http://twitter.com/rem" rel="met">Remy Sharp</a>. I must say, to start with, that is a great read, which has me <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wnas/status/24025721936547840">whipping</a> out my laptop. Even on a sunday morning, before my 2nd breakfast, which is really uncommon. I even started to hack away at this site, just for the heck of it...</p><p>And that is the small thing that I wanted to share with you. I don&#39;t know why but I haven&#39;t gotten around to properly adding the time attribute to this site, even though I got it in #html5 for quite some time now. Somehow it didn&#39;t happen, but anyway, here is the code to add it in <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/">habari</a>.</p><pre><code>&#60;time   datetime=&quot;&#60;?php echo $post-&#62;pubdate-&#62;text_format(&#39;{Y}-{m}-{d}&#39;); ?&#62;&quot;   pubtime&#62;    &#60;?php echo $post-&#62;pubdate-&#62;      text_format(&#39;&#60;span&#62;{M}&#60;/span&#62;                    &#60;span&#62;{d}&#60;/span&#62;,                    &#60;span&#62;{Y}&#60;/span&#62;&#39;);     ?&#62;&#60;/time&#62;</code></pre><p>It&#39;s just a small bit, but I hope it is of help to someone who uses habari...</p><p><em>It&#39;s visible content is in dutch / european order, but I&#39;m sure you can change that to suit yours...</em></p></article></body></html>
