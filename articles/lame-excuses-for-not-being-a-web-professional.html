Sadly, it is true for the most part...<blockquote cite="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200704/lame_excuses_for_not_being_a_web_professional/">Look, itâ€™s very simple. Youâ€™re a programmer. You should be smart enough to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If your IDE or framework produces rubbish for front-end code, donâ€™t let it. Twist its arm to make it produce sane markup.</blockquote><p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200704/lame_excuses_for_not_being_a_web_professional/"><a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200704/lame_excuses_for_not_being_a_web_professional/">Lame excuses for not being a Web professional | 456 Berea Street</a></cite></p></article></body></html>
