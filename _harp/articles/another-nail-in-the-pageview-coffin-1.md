The sites that make me visit multiple pages for one article only make me use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader">reader</a> functionality of safari.</p><p><em>And get annoyed...</em></p><blockquote><p>"Think of how a typical user session works on most news sites these days. A user loads an article (1 pageview), pops open a slideshow (1 pageview), flips through 30 slides of an HTML-based slideshow (30 pageviews). That’s 32 pageviews and a lot of extraneous downloading and page refreshing.</p><p>On new msnbc.com story pages, the above sequence would register one pageview: the initial one. The rest of the interactions occur within the page itself. Can msnbc.com serve ad impressions against in-page interactions? Sure, and that’s key to the strategy, but as a user, your experience is much smoother, and as an advertiser, the impressions you purchase are almost guaranteed to come across human eyes since your ads are only loaded upon user interaction."</p></blockquote><p>(<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2010/06/another-nail-in-the-pageview-coffin">Another Nail in the Pageview Coffin | Mike Industries</a>.)</p></article>
