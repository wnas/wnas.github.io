<article><h2>Different var, same subject</h2><time><span class="day">4</span><span class="month">3</span><span class="year">111</span></time><p>I recently tried to do something and I don't know if it is all that good. If somebody has an opinion about it, I would love to hear it.</p><p>I have been using the <strong>$</strong> suffix for variables that are really jQuery objects. But I keep coming across occurrences that need the real variable, aka not the jQuery one.</p><p>So what I tend to do now is something like:</p><pre><code>collection : {	$foo	: $('.bar'),	foo		: '.bar'}</code></pre><p>In this way I can use both the jQuery object easily and the normal variable, like this:</p><pre><code>// use the jQuery objectcollection.$foo.<em>action()</em>// use the normal object$('body').find(collection.foo)</code></pre><p>What do you think, is this too much or do you use this too?</p><p><em>I am trying to get a better last example, 'cause this ain't all that clear I think...</em></p></article>
