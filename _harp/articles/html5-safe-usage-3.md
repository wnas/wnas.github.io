<article><h2>HTML5 safe usage 3</h2><time><span class="day">2</span><span class="month">9</span><span class="year">110</span></time><p>As you may recal, I wrote a small piece on #html5 input types a while go <a href="http://www.wnas.nl/html5-safe-usage-2">here</a>, in which I stated:</p><blockquote><p>If you use an unsupported input type in a browser it falls back to text, what I didn't knew is that reading the type with JavaScript fails also. CSS attribute selectors are fine, only no JavaScript detection.</p></blockquote><p>As it turns out, I was mistaken. It is quite possible to detect the type of the input elements, all it takes is the reading of the  type attribute, like this:</p><pre><code>$('input').each(function(){	var tt = this.getAttribute('type');	if(!tt)tt='text';	this.className +=' input-'+tt;});</code></pre><p>And voila, we have got a class on the element, with which we can style it or hook some javascript onto it...</p></article>
