<article><h2>jQuery in action</h2><time><span class="day">4</span><span class="month">1</span><span class="year">107</span></time>As of today, I will eat my own (dog)food. Meaning that all of the javascript in this site will be handled with jquery. I will set up a section to test with prototype, dojo, YUI, mochikit and more of that. But for now, jQuery is my library of choice.Why is that...Uhm, I am just plain lazy and jQuery lets me do stuff real fast and easy.For the side bar for example I decided to hide the archives and meta data. You can see them if you click on the header. I will give you some visual confirmation for that in a couple of days, because this is just not good.but what the heck, as I always say: 'do as I say, not as I do'.</article>
