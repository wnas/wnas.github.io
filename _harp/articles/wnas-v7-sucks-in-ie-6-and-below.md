<article><h1>WNAS v7 sucks in IE 6 and below</h1><time><span class="day">7</span><span class="month">6</span><span class="year">2007</span></time>The new design is NOT tested in IE, so if you find anything wrong with it, please drop me a line. I will try to fix things as soon as possible, but it does not have my highest priority.If you find that things are not usable, that is another thing. Those things will get my on my high priority list right away.So, please share my faults with the rest of the world, or IE's depending on who's point of view you share.</article>
